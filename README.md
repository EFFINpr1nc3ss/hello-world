# hello-world
My first GitHub repository.

Hi, I'm am a pretty basic programmer, but I would like to learn more. I hope that through using GitHub I will learn more about programming,finish a few of my personal projects, and maybe even get to contribute to some other people projects.

Oh,my favorite language is any non-.NET BASIC(Obviously I don't use them much, but they are my favorite for sentimental purposes,) and I specialize(which in this case means what I do the most, not what I'm really good at) in creating new programming languages and interpreters.
